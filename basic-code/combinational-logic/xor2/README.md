## TRUTH TABLE

| a     | b     | y     |
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| 0     | 0     | 0     |
| 0     | 1     | 1     |
| 1     | 0     | 1     |
| 1     | 1     | 0     |

## VERILOG CODE

The main part of the code is,

```verilog
    assign y = a ^ b;
```

The entire code is
[xor2.v](xor2.v).

## RUN (SIMULATE)

I used my testbench
[xor2-tb.v](xor2-tb.v) with
[iverilog](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/simulation/iverilog-cheat-sheet)
to simulate and create a `.vcd` file.

```bash
sh run-test.sh
```

## CHECK WAVEFORM

Check you waveform using your `.vcd` file with a waveform viewer.

I used [GTKWave](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/simulation/gtkwave-cheat-sheet)
and launch it using
[launch-gtkwave.sh](launch-gtkwave.sh).

## TESTED IN HARDWARE - BURNED TO A FPGA

To test my design in real hardware, the above code was synthesized using the
[Xilinx Vivado](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/hardware/tools/synthesis/xilinx-vivado-cheat-sheet)
IDE software suite and burned to a FPGA development board.
